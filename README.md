# FightofTheJabberwocky
_Project for AET 358 Next Level Arcade, UT AUSTIN_ 

"You step into the role of Jerry, a misunderstood jabberwocky just trying to enjoy some peace in his forest home. But those ANNOYING villagers, knights, and—ugh—children just won’t leave you alone! Put on the jabberwocky mask and use your terrifying roar and audio cues to scare off those pesky humans."

# Game Description:
Transform into Jerry the Jabberwocky by putting on a controller mask with a built in microphone.  Along with that, three monitors surround you... each with approaching villagers. Be on the lookout as they want to end you! Yell and roar as loud as you can to scare them away. Step on one of three foot pedals as you roar to target your roar to one of the three screens. Each foot pedal corresponds with one screen. Before you roar, make sure the villagers are within Jerry's roar range by waiting for a white outline to surround the villager.

The strength of your roar determines the rate at which you lower villagers health. Kid villagers are fast but have the least health. While knights are slow and have the most health. Choose wisely for which screen you roar at if you get cornered by many villagers, as it may determine the fate of Jerry! One villager attack isn't enough to take you out though! Get hit by 3 villagers and you are out.

# My Role
I worked as a game developer in charge of the programming and technical sides of the project. I used the Unity engine with C# to create the foundations and structures of the game. Some structures I created or implemented include and are not limited to:
- Spawn Manager
- Phase System (morning, afternoon, evening phases)
- Enemy Controllers, Enemy Prefabs, Enemy Pathing and Movement System
- Multi-Display Compability,  Multi Screen Functionality
- Health System
- Microphone Input and Loudness Detection

Besided these structures, I also implemented audio and visual assets which I received from my fellow group members. I implemented the following type of assets:
- 2D Sprites (Enemy and Jerry sprites)
- 2D Animations
- 2D Effects (Enemy Outlines, Enemy UI Alerts)
- SFX (Water flowing, enemy dialouge)
- Music FX (Background music)
  
One key thing I did for the project involves setting up a version control system. I implemented Unity's version of version control, "Unity Version Control" for our project. This version control system allowed me and a 3D environment and modeling specialist on my team to collaborate on Unity outside of class time.

Outside of Unity, I configured a setup for the game to be played with usin 3 monitors, 3 screens, and one microphone.
